I am an engineer and a scientist who loves deciphering the nature of complex systems, from the intricacies of the human genome to the mysteries of neural signal. My career interests span the intersection of artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and computational neuroscience, with a focus on developing innovative computational tools to advance medical research and high-performance computing.

Currently, I am a Senior Research Assistant and Full-Stack Developer at the High-Performance Computing (HPC) Center at the [Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)](https://www.ipm.ac.ir/) in Tehran, Iran. In this role, I lead the development of web-based platforms that enable researchers to access and manage computational resources efficiently. My work involves integrating cutting-edge technologies such as Java Spring, React, and Docker to create seamless, high-performance systems for scientific research.

My research focuses on cancer genetics, immunology, and neuroscience, where I apply machine learning and bioinformatics techniques to analyze complex datasets, such as gene expression and neural signals. I have developed computational tools for HLA typing, cancer prognosis, and neural signal processing, contributing to advancements in medical diagnostics and treatment strategies.

Previously, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at Tarbiat Modares University and the Royan Institute, where I conducted research on cancer biology, neural signal processing, and high-performance computing. I also contributed to the development of novel methods for analyzing multi-electrode array (MEA) data and designed real-time applications for closed-loop neural stimulation systems.

I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) from [Sharif University of Technology](https://www.sharif.edu/), where I focused on unsupervised neural spike sorting using deep learning methods. My B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from  [Kharazmi University](https://www.khu.ac.ir/) laid the foundation for my expertise in programming, algorithms, and system design.

I am passionate about leveraging my skills in machine learning, bioinformatics, and high-performance computing to solve complex problems in medicine and neuroscience. Whether it's developing computational tools for cancer research or optimizing neural signal processing algorithms, I am driven by the potential of technology to transform healthcare and scientific discovery.
