## About Me

I’m a multidisciplinary engineer and scientist with a passion for merging advanced technologies with biomedical research. My work sits at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, high‑performance computing, and full‑stack web development, where I build innovative tools and platforms to empower research in genetics, cancer biology, and neural signal processing.

At the [Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)](https://www.ipm.ac.ir/), I lead the development and maintenance of robust web systems and computational pipelines, ensuring that researchers have seamless access to high‑performance resources. Whether I’m optimizing complex HPC systems or designing intelligent algorithms, my goal is to translate data into insights that drive scientific breakthroughs.

Previously, I contributed to important projects in cancer genetics and neural signal processing at leading research institutes, gaining diverse experience that fuels my commitment to both technology and life sciences. My academic journey—from earning an MSc in Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) at [Sharif University of Technology](https://www.sharif.edu/) to a BSc in Computer Engineering from [Kharazmi University](https://www.khu.ac.ir/)—has equipped me with the skills to tackle today’s most challenging problems.
